# btw data retriever

This Python script fetches data from an API and saves it to a JSON file.
The script makes API requests to retrieve product data, appends the data to an existing JSON file, and sleeps for a random interval before continuing.
Make sure to set the necessary environment variables (API_URL, STORE_ID, LIMIT, IS_BACKEND, ACCESS_TOKEN) before running the script.
